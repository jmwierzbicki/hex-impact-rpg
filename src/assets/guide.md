# CHARACTER CREATION :  ACCUMULATION

ALL ACCUMULATION STEPS CAN BE CHOSEN AND APPLIED AT ANY ORDER. YOU CAN ROLL EVERYTHING AND THEN MAKE CHOICES


## STEP : ATTRIBUTES

Attributes are basic information about every character in the game.

Choose one of the random sets of starting values of attributes. All sets have the same sum of points. Attributes with value of 6 or above are considered superhuman power.

    STRENGTH: physical strength, resilience and power

    PROWESS: close combat proficiency

    AWARENESS: perception, insight, intuition

    INTELECT: smarts, knowledge, wisdom

    WILLPOWER: mental resilience and flexibility


## STEP : SPECIALITIES

Specialities are bonuses to actions in a broad area, based on education and experience. Each adds +1 to any attribute roll connected to the topic. You can take same speciality multiple times and their bonus stack

You start the game with 1 free random speciality. You can get more thanks to other steps:  **Improvements**, **Origins** or **Burning**


## STEP : ORIGINS

Origins represent broad idea how your character acquired super powers and become a hero.

Choose one of the 3 random origins. Each origins give bonuses during character creation which you can apply at any moment


## STEP : IMPROVEMENTS

Improvements are 8 random ways you can improve your character by either adding another power to their list, increasing power’s level, adding new specialities or increasing an attribute. If an improvement would grant you another instance of the same power or specialty you just increase it's level by 1. You will be presented with list of 10 improvements of which you can take 8. 


## STEP : POWER DEVELOPMENT

After adding your power to the list you can : \t

    - decrease power level by 1 and add an extra
    - increase power level by 1 and add a limit (consult with GM)
    - add a limit and an extra (consult with GM)
    - Burn power to lose it and boost other powers or attributes

You can burn power to increase a level of other power by +1 as long as burned power has equal or higher level

You can burn power to increase a level of one of your attributes by +1 as long as burned power has equal or higher level

You can burn power to increase a level of one of your specialties by +1 
    
    EXAMPLE : 
    Power A = 4                          
    Power B = 4 [Burn for Power A]
    Power C = 4
    Power D = 4  

          =

    Power A = 5
    Power C = 4
    Power D = 4 [Burn for Power C]

          =

    Power A = 5 
    Power C = 5 [Burn for Power A]

          =

    Power A = 6 [Add an extra]

          =

    Power A = 5
